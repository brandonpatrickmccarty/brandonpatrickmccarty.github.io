# About Me
## My Interests
I love my **family, sports, learning**, and **building things**.
* **Family**

    I've been **married for nearly 14 years** and have a **7 year old daughter** and **5 year old son**. One of the most rewarding things for me right now is to watch my daughter compete in gymnastics and my son in baseball.

* **Sports**
 
    I use to be far more active than I am now, but I played college football, love playing **recreational basketball** and **coaching my son** in baseball and whatever else he likes to do. I'm not much help to my daughter in regards to coaching, but I enjoy **learning about gymnastics** and all the nuances of it.

* **Learning**
    	
    In Feb 2015, I **left the military after serving 5 years**, and had no idea what I was going to do. I had just finished my undergraduate degree while serving, but really didn't know how my skills would translate into a civilian job.
    
    I decided to start a **consulting firm for non profits** in the summer of 2015 with a college buddy of mine with absolutetly no experience in anything business or non profits. I really enjoyed "drinking through the fire hose" on everything ranging from what is an LLC, how to build and manage a sales pipeline to setting up an accounting system and closing the "books".  
    
    In 2016 I decided to get some formal education in business where I enrolled in an **Executive MBA program at Pepperdine University** and graduated in August of 2017.  
    
    In 2017 I decided to another business, in an industry and market I knew nothing about. **SaaS procurement software for the dental industry**. I speant the last 8 years learning everything I could about procurement and accounts payable, how to build a teach startup and most recently how to get it acquired which happend early Feb 2025.  
    
    During my time at CureMint, I did and could do just about anything **besides** actually build the software we provided to the market. It was an extremly frustrating experience for me to have that black box of knowledge as we built the business. I found it hard to empathize and lead that part of the business.  
    
    I'm now 39 and have decided to upgrade my technical knowledge and skills. Hence my enrollment at Wake Tech, which I am enjoying.  
    
* **Building Things**
 	
    I have enjoy building businesses that impact customers lives, but also the lives our the employees that work there. I love building cultures, systems, processes and realtionships.

## Websites I recommend
* [CoureEra](https://www.coursera.org/) - There are many other similiar sites, but the fact that just about anything is at your fingertips to learn at this website is mind blowing to me. Most recently, I've really interested in the many moving pieces of AI and machine learning
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - Without this website , I don't know what I would have done when it came to understanding the mechanics and math as we raised capital for our business and how dilution and preference structure worked. I go here for anything where I want to be explained something like I am 8 yearls old, which is often : ).
